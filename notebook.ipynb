    "# Learning Sentence Representations from Question-Answer Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explore methods to learn fixed length vector representations for variable lengthed \"short\" sentences (on the order of at most around 50 words) of text data. These \"short\" sentences are questions scraped from an online forum like answers.com, and each sample is accompanied by the top response (answer) corresponding to each question. We use question-answer data scraped from an online forum because the \"label\" (answer) for each training sample (question) is free. We use quotes around the word \"label\" because these labels are more like \"soft labels\" since they are responses taken verbatim from the general public. Our goal is to use these labels in order to learn sentence representations from within a specific topic domain (like \"diabetes\")."

    "### Text-based Representation Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of understanding user questions might be the starting point if you are attempting to build a chatbot to automatically handle customer queries. As an initial step, you might want to cluster queries into different high-level feature categories, requiring a numerical learned feature representation of consistent dimensionality for all queries. A fully supervised approach could potentially work for this, where a model is trained to output the correct answer given a quesion, but would most likely require a lot of data and some clever model design and depend too heavily on the answer \"labels\" which may sometimes be donwright wrong. On the other hand, this could be attempted in an entirely unsupervised manner, perhaps by learning to unscramble augmented question strings or impute missing words. Unsupervised methods may learn to bias too heavily towards unexpected features (like individual words or low-level grammatical logic), and still, we have useful information nonetheless in the answers, so why not try to use this. The method we choose here involves using comparison-based learning samples (between questions and answers) in order to directly learn a feature representation for text-based inputs. Specifically, by constructing \"positive\" question-answer pairs, where the paired answer is the \"correct\" answer, and \"negative\" question-answer pairs, where the paired answer is the \"incorrect\" answer, we can train a model to simply discriminate between these two pairs. Usually this is done by satisfying some criterion based on a distance/similarity measurement in a learned, fixed-dimensionality feature space, requiring that samples from a \"positive\" pair be mapped closer together (on average) than samples form a \"negative\" pair. Here, we explore the learned features for some of these comparison-based representation learning models, including the [Triplet Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6622.pdf) and the [Siamese Network](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1993/file/288cc0ff022877bd3df94bc9360b9c5d-Paper.pdf).
